## Detailed Overview

### Python Scripts

1. **Calculator.py**: This script demonstrates basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It serves as an introduction to handling user inputs and performing mathematical calculations in Python.

2. **List-Set-Tuple.py**: A script that explains how to create and use lists, sets, and tuples in Python. It covers operations such as indexing, adding elements, and differentiating between these data structures.

3. **main.py**: The main script that serves as a focal point for demonstrating a variety of functionalities. It may include functions, loops, and other fundamental Python programming concepts.

4. **printing.py**: This script showcases different methods of printing output in Python, including formatted strings and concatenation.

5. **py to exe notes.txt**: A guide with notes on how to convert Python scripts into executable `.exe` files. This can be helpful for sharing Python programs without requiring users to have Python installed.

### Images and Assets

- The provided images (`Hamburger.png`, `Pizza.png`, etc.) are likely used in the UI for graphical demonstration or visualization purposes.

### Executable

- **clock.exe**: An executable that may demonstrate a graphical clock application. This could be an example of how to use Python with GUI libraries to create interactive applications.

## Getting Started

To run the Python scripts, ensure you have Python installed. Simply navigate to the directory containing the scripts and run them using the Python command:

```sh
python script_name.py
```

For example, to run the calculator script:

```sh
python Calculator.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (if any) are likely specified within each script, typically at the top in the form of `import` statements.
